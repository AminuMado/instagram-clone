<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This was the final project for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-javascript-final-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project's</a> JavaScript curriculum. The goal of the project is to build/re-create a functional social media platform with a backend. This project is closely modeled after instagram, it was made with the React JS Library, TypeScript and Firebase.</p>

## Built with

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- React

## Development & Tools

### Javascript Framework

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

### Libraries, extensions and tools

- React Router - Router tool for React applications
- Visual Studio Code - IDE
- Npm - Package Manager
- Webpack - Code bundler
- [Firebase's Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - Scalable, flexible NoSQL database for web, mobile and server development.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A linter tool to standardize code
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Code formatter
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting
- [GH-Pages Deployment](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f)

## Objectives & Outcomes

- Interact with a NoSQL flexible database.
- Design an application with a clean user interface.
- Understand and integrate a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider in Firebase into the app.
- Familiarize with Firebase's services, i.e Cloud Firestore, Firebase Auth.
- Further improve React proficiency in functional components using Hooks.
- Further imporve Js knowledge using TypeScript.

## Challenges

- Using a database without joins and with request limits was a problem. If I were to redo the app now, I'd probably restructure each document so as to reduce calls.
- Managing the stylesheets. I mostly separated concerns by component, but there's a lot of overlap that could have been fixed with more planning.

## Future works

As on any project, there are always more things that I would like to implement that didn't make it to the final version you see live. This section lists a few of them for future me to pickup and add them.

- Add followers and following funtionality.
- Add direct messaging funtionality.
